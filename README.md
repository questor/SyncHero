# SyncHero

A tool to sync and keep informed on a repo tree structure with the possibility to copy files after syncing.

ALPHA-STATE. All functions implemented, but not tested deeply and no documentation.

I've tried to use peru(https://github.com/buildinspace/peru) to fit my needs, but the workflow differs too much. Hence I wrote my own tool.
